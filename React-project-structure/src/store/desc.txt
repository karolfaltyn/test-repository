The store folder will be included if you decide to use redux in your project. Inside it, there are actions and reducers subfolder to manage redux states.

Mostly, the actions and reducers will be called in the page components so they usually named based on pages that use them.

If your application is a small-to-medium scale project, try to maximize the usage of the props and states component before using redux. If thatâ€™s too complicated, well, you can use redux.
