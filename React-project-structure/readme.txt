Do we need to include all the folders from the beginning?
Well, No. You don’t have to include all folders from the beginning of the project.

For instance, If you’re not sure to use redux or not in your project, you don’t have to create a store folder yet.

Services folder is also not necessary if you sure that your project only consumes a small number of APIs.

However, the assets, components, parts, and pages folders are important to be arranged from the beginning to manage better codes.

That’s it. What do you think? If you have an opinion, please feel free to comment and suggest your ideas so we can have more views about this.
