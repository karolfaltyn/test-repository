# Test Repository

My first GitHub repository.

## Introduction

This repo is mostly used to store useful code that I use in other repositories.

Sometimes it is used to test fragments of code before I add it to final repo.

### Inside are:

- CSS Reset code modified for my needs
- React projects folders structure
